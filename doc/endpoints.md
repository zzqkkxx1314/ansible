Endpoints
=========

For this document we are including both OpenStack API services and internal
dependencies services like RabbitMQ and MySQL in our definition of endpoints.

There are three IP addresses we use for endpoints:

1. Each controllers internal "undercloud" IP address.
2. The floating internal "undercloud" IP address shared by the controllers.
3. The floating external IP address shared by the controllers.

Since we are already running HAProxy to terminate SSL and provide high
availability for external API requests, we decided to leverage this to protect
against API service failures on the controller which has the floating IP and
connect to HAProxy over SSL for internal API requests. This avoids the
complexity of having third port for each API service for HAProxy listen on for
plain text request, or binding HAProxy and API services each to specific IPs.

Since we using SSL for internal communication we need to connect via hostname
rather than IP so the clients can validate the certificate. Rather than using
split-horizon DNS or similar so the internal API clients connect to the
internal floating IP, we went ahead and had the internal API clients connect
the same public address as external clients. One disadvantage with this choice,
is lose log visibility into which internal node the API request originated
from since we NAT the internal requests.
